## "Music for my Soul"

This repository contains code for a Music Generator project. This webpage allows a user to randomly generate 8 different colors (arranged in a grid) and have a song be presented that correlates to each of the randomly generated colors. Additionally, the user can choose to save one or more of the generated songs to their Saved Songs section, allowing them to have easy access to any songs they might want to come back to. Below is an image of the application, as well as a link to the deployed site.
